# sqlalchemy-challenge-updated
Updated sqlalchemy-challenge for Mod 10

The original SurfsUp app.py code has been debugged and updated to ensure proper function. The previous code (found in repository: sqlalchemy-challenge) was not properly indented and had the session(engine) in more places than necessary, which has been fixed.

Help was received from tutor Angel Milla with fixing the indentation.
