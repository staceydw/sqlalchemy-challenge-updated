# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this challenge, I used various methods to parse through data regarding precipitation, station IDs, temperatures in order to make comparisons. Various graphs, such as the histogram was created for the query of the previous 12 months of data for each station. 

Using Flask, a climate app was created, including a homepage. All available routes are listed. Additionally, query results were converted from the precipitation analysis for the last 12 months of data, and a JSON dictionary was returned for that, as well as for the station dataset. 

Lastly, the Flask jsonify function was used to convert the API data to a JSON response object. 

Resources: 
Help was received on this challenge from Angel Milla (tutor). Angel helped review the Climate code to find the little issues that were causing errors. The original code I created was more complicated than necessary.

ChatGPT was used to help with Flask and the creation of a connection and how to create a homepage. 

Lastly, class recordings were reviewed to make sure the API portion of the assignment was done correctly.
